# Stock Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical stock price data and develop a predictive model to forecast future prices. Using Python and multiple data science libraries, retail investors can gain insight into stock market trends and thus make informed decisions. The best use for this project is the visualization and analysis done in seconds. As a retail investor, I now use this code virtually every week or so. It saves so much time and energy. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- yfinance (Used to pull historical stock data from Yahoo Finance)
- Pandas (Makes my life easier by providing proper structures that make it easy to handle time series data (aka stock prices))
- Matplotlib (Helps with the visualization of data by creating graphs)
- Scikit-learn (Provides machine-learning algorithims to forecast stock prices)

## Features
- Download and preprocess stock data
- Visualize stock price trends and returns
- Build a predictive model for future price forecasts

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install required libraries using: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script: python stock_analysis.py


## Insights
This project enhances your understanding of stock market trends through data-driven analysis. It's great for making informed decisions without having to spend hours of research. It literally only takes one minute, tops.
